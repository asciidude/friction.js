# I gave up. ðŸ˜”
This project acted mainly as a refresher to webhook management, type safety, etc. It's been a while since I've even touched an API and while it achieved it's goal of helping me "deoxidize the rust", I was interested more in providing a 100% API coverage, type safe, and limitless Discord API NPM module.

It has become very obvious to me this was not a good idea. The stress it was inducing was... something else. After taking some time off of this project, I've come to realize covering the *entire* Discord API is too much for a one-man team to cover. I tried advertising it to get some help to no avail, just thinking about this project made me dread even opening VS Code, and probably most importantly, I was staying up until 3 A.M. every night just trying to get this project over with... only to cover 1% of the expansive Discord API.

I apologize to anyone interested in this project, but honestly, [Discord.js](https://npmjs.com/discord.js) is and always will be a much better option to go for.

If this project picks up in popularity I might continue it and optimize the code, but for now, consider it publically archived.

});

client.on(Events.MessageCreate, async (message: Message) => {
    if(message.author.bot) return;
    const channel = await (new Channel(client, message.channelId)).get();
